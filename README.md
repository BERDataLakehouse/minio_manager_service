# MinIO Manager Service

A centralized FastAPI service to manage MinIO users, groups, and policies for data governance with KBase authentication integration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT WARNING**

**üö® SINGLE INSTANCE ONLY - DO NOT DEPLOY MULTIPLE INSTANCES üö®**

This service has a known race condition issue with concurrent policy updates when multiple instances are running. Deploying multiple instances will result in:

- **Data Loss**: Concurrent policy updates can overwrite each other
- **Permission Issues**: Users may lose access to paths they should have  
- **Silent Failures**: No error indication when race conditions occur

**Issue Reference**: [kbase/cdm-minio-service#25](https://github.com/kbase/cdm-minio-service/issues/25)

Until this issue is resolved, **always deploy exactly ONE instance** of this service.
